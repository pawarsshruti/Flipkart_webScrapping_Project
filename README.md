# Flipkart_webScrapping_Project
This project is a web scraping tool built with Python that extracts PlayStation product links from Flipkart. It uses the BeautifulSoup library for parsing HTML content and the Requests library for making HTTP requests.
Features of this projects are :
1]Extracts product links for PlayStation products from Flipkart.
2]Prints the URLs of the extracted product links.
3]Retrieves and prints the information of the first(or any specified) product page.


Lastly I would like to thank the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries (and many such libraries) for making web scraping easier.
